		<h1>A Quick Guide to the Solar System</h1>

		<p>In all the galaxy clusters, galaxies, and planetary systems (up to 300 just in Milky Way!), there is only one that the human race has confirmed holds life. Among all the cosmos, there is a solar system that holds a star called the <em>"Sun"</em> and a planet called <em>Earth</em> where life exists and it ponders the intricacies of the world, or more accurately "worlds", beyond their own.</p>
<br/>
		<p>Let's take a few short moments to know some more about this solar system that holds our dear planet!</p>

		<li><strong>Facts</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Location: We can be found in the Orion Spur, an arm of the Milky Way galaxy. The Orion Spur is 1 of the 2 arms found in the galaxy.</li>
				<li>Size: Our solar system is estimated to span about a diameter of 30 trillion km/18.6 trillion miles, or 200,000 AU across. That's more than 3 light years!</li>
				<li>Age: It is estimated to be 4.6 billion years old, obviously, starting with the formation of the Sun!</li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>Timeline</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>4.6 billion years back:
					<dd>A possible nearby shock from an exploding star triggers the formation of the solar system.</dd></li>
				<li>4.59 billion years back:
					<dd>The giants (large planets) of our solar systems are formed (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).</dd></li>
				<li>4.5 billion years back:
					<dd>The smaller <em>planets</em> finally begin to form (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars).</dd></li>
				<li>4.5-4.1 billion years back:
					<dd>Because of gravitation, the Sun begins to seperate from the rest of its protostar siblings.</dd></li>
			</ul>

		<p> Amazingly, there is so so much more to say about our specific planetary system, and so much more that we are not even aware of! (E.g. The habitability of all the celestial bodies, particularly, with no wonder why, the planets! - Which ones are habitable, have been habitable, might be in the oncoming future?). We've even launched space probes to adventure farther into the depths of the solar system (Voyager 1 & 2, both having reached "interstellar space"). So, I encourage all to keep pondering what lies beyond our world, especially on what is vague/unexplored in this website, so we may be able to answer more questions and develop a more detailed understanding of what our universe is and what we can do with it. :)</p>
